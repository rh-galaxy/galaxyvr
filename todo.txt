A bit of network programming in c#.

Goal: Implement 4 player multiplayer for Galaxy Forces VR
*Current status of project
- Unity and C# is used.
- Game is single player and in mature state.
- Open.Nat library is used to setup port forwarding with UPnP.
- SendRecv.cs will contain the new code, and contains a first (broken) version.
- PHP database is used in the Create/Join procedure:
(mpgames_create.php accessed when a game is created, and then continuously access it every 30 sec while the game is waiting for joining players)
(mpgames_join.php accessed to get a list of all games created that are waiting for players)
- GUI for the connection procedure is partly done, I will continue on this.
- It is a VR game but it runs without VR with mouse and keyboard, SteamVR is needed.
*TODO
1. Connect/Join code to go through firewall/router (internet side)
During testing it will be important to also make it possible to connect from the local network side.
Master  <-> Router <-> Internet <-> Client2
Client1 <|                       |> Router <-> Client3
It should be possible to implement this with C# sockets.
Now TcpClient and TcpListener is used but may have to change to Socket (lower level) to be able to set port used to one in the range fwd from Open.Nat.
- SendRecv.cs and GameManager.cs (and Menu.cs) source files are the only files needed to modify to achieve this.
2. Make the GUI for this procedure (partly done).
3. Game-logic (ingame messsages for bullets, enemies, moving doors, and the 4 players)

Currently I need help with 1.

Game can be checked out at https://github.com/rh-galaxy/galaxyvr/tree/multiplayer

-------
Release
- Trailer: Seems only 30fps is shown not 60 (need fix by Oculus)
Release for Oculus Quest
- Get the concept approved by Oculus (currently denied)

-------
Known issues/small things undone
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "door movement"-msg in the replay data.
- Test different textures for the single colored cave edges.
- Test different background textures for the back-plate and borders.
- Windows on the house is not exactly the same height.
- There is no back wall of hangar building. Visible through door.
- Make XBox-controller not be unresponsive after pause and unpause
 (after accessing Virtual Desktop) (Might not be possible, and not a requirement)

Must do:
- Enable code for Oculus entitlement check (done, and keep it done later in Release version)

Possible future extensions
- www.galaxy-forces-vr.com - Better/more contents
- Add more official maps/new tilesets (digital world, ?)
- Add achievements for the extra official maps
