- Credits page
Release
- Images in different sizes for release on the Oculus Store
- Images in different sizes for release on the Steam Store
- Game play promotion video
- Test/fix it working on minimum req hardware

-------
Known issues/small things undone
- Particle system and force field does not work correctly, tried to delete
   and recreate with no luck... out of ideas. (but it's better than before,
   will have to be acceptable)
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "enemy killed"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "door movement"-msg in the replay data.
- Handle the first few frames in GameLevel.Update better, the game is now paused while loading
   but the level should not show while it is loading, as it is visible that objects "pop up"
- Manage to remove the Prefabs/Materials folder in Unity project (use same mat in Resources)
- Fix the objects in the Prefabs folder to be done like it should be
   now there are models (ship1, enemy4, U, U_wider) mixed with the real prefab objects
- Make 1024x1024 image for game icon (the current icon is 128x128 and comes from the old game)
   Set this in Edit->Project_Settings->Player->Icon in Unity.

Must do:
- Prevent running the game in non VR (later in Release version)
- Enable code for Oculus entitlement check (later in Release version)
- Checkpoint sounds are not clean... there is some unwanted noise in them
- Bulletfire sound is not clean... there is some unwanted noise
