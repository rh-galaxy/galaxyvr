Enemies
- Create them in 3D [enemy 0..3,5,6]
- Implement them in code
Menu
- More contents (could be Game Name text/logo, animated objects, clouds, anything really)
- Better gfx (different textures for the level select elements)
- Animation (movement) of the element that the player is looking on, or highlighting.
- Sound for the above, and when something is selected.
- Make part 2 of the menu - after a level is selected in part 1, shows 3 options -
   play, play your best replay, play the world record replay
- In part 2 - show your score vs the world best on the level, also show your rank
   (gold, silver or bronze), load this from website
- Settings to turn the music on/off (+a minimum of other settings).
The VR room around the player
- More contents (could be clouds and a skybox, or a room, or blackness in space, anything really)
Website
- www.galaxy-forces-vr.com exists.
- Better/more contents (+the hi-scores, but they are implemented)
- Credits page
Release
- Images in different sizes for release on the Oculus Store
- Game play promotion video
- Test/fix it working on minimum req hardware


Known issues/small things undone
- Particle system and force field does not work correctly, tried to delete
   and recreate with no luck... out of ideas. (but it's better than before,
   will have to be acceptable)
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "enemy killed"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "door movement"-msg in the replay data.
- More graphical game status
- Handle the first few frames in GameLevel.Update better, the game should be paused
   while level is still being loaded (Time.timeScale = low, but then update will not run).
   And the level should not show while it is loading, as it is visible that objects "pop up"
- Prevent running the game in non VR (later in Release version)
- Enable code for  Oculus entitlement check (later in Release version)
- Manage to remove the Prefabs/Materials folder in Unity project (use same mat in Resources)
- Make 1024x1024 image for game icon (the current icon is 128x128 and comes from the old game)
   Set this in Edit->Project_Settings->Player->Icon in Unity.
- Fix the objects in the Prefabs folder to be done like it should be
   now there are models (ship1, enemy4, U, U_wider) mixed with the real prefab objects
- Checkpoint sounds are not clean... there is some unwanted noise in them
- Switch web to HTTPS, and make the game access HTTPS
