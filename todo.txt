Map elements
- Landing zone, hangar building - low poly model (only visual)
- Landing zone, antenna - low poly model (only visual)
- Map decorations, trees - low poly model (visual, and collision in map)
- Map decorations, barrels - low poly model (visual, and collision in map)
- Map decorations, red/green house in 3 parts (left, center, (right)) -
   low poly model (visual, and collision in map)
Door element
- A low poly model for the end points of the door (only one needs to be created,
   can be rotated to make all parts)
- Implement the door element in code
Enemies
- Create them in 3D [enemy 0..3,5,6]
- Implement them in code
Sound
- Add existing music to the menu and game
- Add existing sound fx in the game
Menu
- More contents (could be Game Name text/logo, animated objects, clouds, anything really)
- Better gfx (different textures for the level select elements)
- Make part 2 of the menu - after a level is selected in part 1, shows 3 options -
   play, play your best replay, play the world record replay
- In part 2 - show your score vs the world best on the level, also show your rank
   (gold, silver or bronze), load this from website
- Settings to turn the music on/off (+a minimum of other settings).
The VR room around the player
- More contents (could be clouds and a skybox, or a room, or blackness in space, anything really)
(Replay)
- Implemented ->
- Online hi-scores - As HTTP implemented (switch web to HTTPS, and make that work)
- The hi-score implementation on the website is done
Website
- www.galaxy-forces-vr.com exists.
- Better/more contents (+the hi-scores, but they are implemented)
Release
- Images in different sizes for release on the Oculus Store
- Game play promotion video
- Test/fix it working on minimum req hardware


Known issues/small things undone
- Thruster particles not as it should be (the force field does not always work in a build)
   try and delete it and add it again?
- Icon for achievement 17, Trigger (Fire 1000 bullets).
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "enemy killed"-msg in the replay data.
- Show minimap (take impl from old game)
- More graphical game status
- Handle the first few frames in MapGenerator.Update better, the game should be paused
   while level is still being loaded (Time.timeScale = low?). And the level should not
   show while it is loading, as it is visible that objects "pop up"
- Rename PlayerController.cs to Player.cs
- Rename MapGenerator.cs to something better since it handles the whole game...
- Prevent running the game in non VR (later in Release version)
- Enable code for  Oculus entitlement check (later in Release version)
- Manage to remove the Prefabs/Materials folder in Unity project (use same mat in Resources)
- Replace image for Textures/128_hour_glass.png - maybe animated circle?
- Replace image for Textures/256_cog.png - cleaner look
- Make 1024x1024 image for game icon (the current icon is 128x128 and comes from the old game)
   Set this in Edit->Project_Settings->Player->Icon in Unity.
- Fix the objects in the Prefabs folder to be done like it should be
   now there are models (ship1, enemy4, U, U_wider) mixed with the real prefab objects

Hiscore dilemma
- achievements_get.php input: username, user_id_number
creates a new entry in members_t if user_id_number is not found
updates the entry in members_t with username if user_id_number is found but username is different
always sets/updates last_access time in members_t
the reply consist of a text of all levels and limits and the users best score for all levels

this is run when a level has been selected in the game

- achievements_post.php input: username, user_id_number, level, counter, replay_blob
check if user_id_number exist in members_t and that counter match with last_access in members_t (for security)
check if the score is better, then creates a new entry, or update existing with the new score

this is run when a score is beaten or first time a level is won

1. anyone can fake change someones name if they know the user_id_number
 and "take over" that persons score since only the name is public, not the id
2. anyone can spam the db with new fake entries
3. there could be same name for two or more users creating all sorts of trouble
4. if we want the user_id_number to not be public we must refer to others hiscores (the world records)
 by name when loading their replay, and not by id.

maybe don't use user_id_number, and that way ignore users that have changed their name - the name at
 creation of a score is permanent. this solves 1.
 
maybe oculus don't let people rename their user to anything that has been used before?
that would make 3 go away (one are allowed 1 name change per 6 months i think).

to not hinder people sending score if someone has made a spam entry with another name with their 
user_id_number name should still be updated in members_t, but any added score with a previous name
will be permanent

-----------------
example 1
userName1,id1 starts a game, entry created
userName1,id1 adds a valid hiscore
userNameSpam,id1 loads the start game page, entry updated
userName1,id1 starts a game, entry name updated
userName1,id1 adds a valid hiscore

userName1,id1 is unaffected by the problem

-----------------
example 2
userName1,id1 starts a game, entry created
userName1,id1 adds a valid hiscore
spam userName1,id2 loads the start game page, entry created
userName1,id1 starts a game, nothing happens
userName1,id1 adds a valid hiscore

userName1,id1 is unaffected by the problem, but two
 entries with the same name exist in members_t

-----------------
example 3
userName1,id1 starts a game, entry created
userName1,id1 adds a valid hiscore
userName2,id1 starts a game, entry name updated
userName2,id1 adds a valid hiscore

id1 now has two entries in achievememts_t but they display/sort
 under different names and if that is not considered a problem
 we are fine...

Seems we should use the name for hiscore, and only keep the user_id_number
 in members_t as a way of linking a "start game action" with a later
 "send hiscore action"
Solves problems 1,4 and 3 may not be a problem - but they sort under the
 same name should it happen.
 2 is manageable since one could go and cleanup entries that has never
 sent in a hiscore...
 
Think we must handle it this way since we cannot know when users change their names
 other than that the name will be different if a player plays the game again after
 the switch.
