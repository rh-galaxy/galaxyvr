-------
Known issues/small things undone
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "enemy killed"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "door movement"-msg in the replay data.
- Handle the first few frames in GameLevel.Update better, the game is now paused while loading
   but the level should not show while it is loading, as it is visible that objects "pop up"
  Hide level with a quad in front of the camera until complete?
- Test different textures for the single colored cave edges.
- Test different background textures for the back-plate and borders.
- Windows on the house is not exactly the same height.
- There is no back wall of hangar building. Visible through door.

Must do:
- Enable code for Oculus entitlement check (later in Release version)

Possible future extensions
- Add external maps directory and present and enable playing the levels there
 (distribute existing map editor on the web site)
- Add more official maps/new tilesets (digital world, ?)
- Add achievements for the extra official maps
