Release
- Use Unity non beta (not a requirement)
- Submit app: set correct supported controllers (need bug fix by Oculus)
- Trailer: Seems only 30fps is shown not 60 (need fix by Oculus)
Release for Oculus Quest
- Get the concept approved by Oculus (currently denied)

-------
Known issues/small things undone
- Maybe have a "remove bullet"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "enemy killed"-msg in the replay data.
- Maybe have a "door movement"-msg in the replay data.
- Handle the first few frames in GameLevel.Update better, the game is now paused while loading
   but the level should not show while it is loading, as it is visible that objects "pop up"
  Hide level with a quad in front of the camera until complete?
- Test different textures for the single colored cave edges.
- Test different background textures for the back-plate and borders.
- Windows on the house is not exactly the same height.
- There is no back wall of hangar building. Visible through door.
- Make XBox-controller not be unresponsive after pause and unpause
 (after accessing Virtual Desktop) (Might not be possible, and not a requirement)

Must do:
- Enable code for Oculus entitlement check (done, and keep it done later in Release version)

Possible future extensions
- www.galaxy-forces-vr.com - Better/more contents
- Make it work better with vive input.
- Add more official maps/new tilesets (digital world, ?)
- Add achievements for the extra official maps
