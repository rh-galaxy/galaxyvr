Thank you for the acquisition of the Planets Pack

Requires Unity 5.0 or higher. 

Planets pack contains highly detailed planets and 2 space backgrounds ready to use in unity 5. 

Key features : 
- All textures have a resolution of 8192 x 4096 
- All texture sets are PBR ready. 
- Custom shaders are provided for best results, which includes a planet shader, a cloud and an atmosphere shader. 
- All textures are using a longitude-latitude UV set. 
- The package contains 108 textures, 4 shaders as well as a planet and a ring geometry. 

The models have all been tested in DX9, DX11 mode (Shader models 3 and 5) and in the webplayer. 

How to use :
Simply drag drop the prefabs into your scene. The size of the planets are quite small by default, but it depends on the usage, so, simply scale the prefabs for larger planets.

Video showcase : 
The video seen on the product page is using some post effects, like SE Natural Bloom & Dirty lens, which is highly recommanded. 

All textures in this package has been created with Grand Designer, the procedural universe generator, available on steam.
